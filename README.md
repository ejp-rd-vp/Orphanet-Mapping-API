# Orphanet-Mapping-API
This project focusses on the Orphanet mapping API.

The Orphanet nomenclature is a multilingual, standardised, controlled medical terminology specific to rare diseases, that includes all clinical entities registered in the Orphanet database (www.orpha.net). Each clinical entity (disorder, group of disorders, or subtype of a disorder) is associated with a unique numerical identifier named ORPHAcode, as well as a preferred term, synonyms, and a definition.
